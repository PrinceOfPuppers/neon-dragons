# snake-360
A 2 player game I made similar to slither.io, (only realized the similarity after I started making it)

Playing The Game
----------------
Click snakes to start

Controls:

    player 1 uses WASD, player 2 use arrow keys

    A/LeftArrow to move left
    D/RightArrow to move right

    (after first appearence change)
    W/UpArrow to dash forward

    (after second appearence change)
    S/DownArrow to sheild


Goal:

    the goal of the game is currently to be the last person alive, you die by having your snake
    drop below 2 segments in length.

    In the future I plan to have the games time out after 5 or so minutes and state the winner 
    as the person with the longest snake


GamePlay:

    You can shorten you apponent by eating their segments (running your head into their body), 
    just be careful go for their first segment or you will mutually eat eachother.

    You can pick up orbs to increase or decrease your length; green increases, red decreases. 
    the more green/ red the orb, the greater the change.

    eating someone (including yourself) while they're sheilding is an insta-death for you!

Devlopment Goals
----------------

-add particle effect on dead and on head change

-maybe have game pause on dead for a second when displaying particles

-have cut off segments drop an orb proportional to how many segments where cut off
